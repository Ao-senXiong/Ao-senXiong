## Professional Experience  

**Applied Scientist Intern**  
*Amazon, Automated Reasoning Group* (2024)  
- Applied an immutability type checker to AWS internal codebases.  
- Translating Dafny to Java with Checker Framework annotations.  

**Graduate Research Assistant**  
*University of Waterloo* (2023 – Present)  
- Contributed to an immutability type checker and inference tools for Java.  
- Worked on the Checker Framework, fixing false negatives and adding new features for Nullness and Initialization checkers.  
- Developed a VSCode extension using LSP to detect potential errors and improve IDE support for pluggable type systems.

## Selected Projects  

**Checker Framework Contributions**  
- Improved nullness and initialization checkers to enhance static analysis tools for Java developers.  

**PICO: Practical Immutability for Classes and Objects**  
- Built an optional immutability type checker for Java and implemented type inference to reduce annotation overhead.  

**Joos Compiler**  
- Created a Java subset compiler, implementing lexer, parser, semantic analysis, and code generation.  

**Boolean Satisfiability Solver**  
- Developed a SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm and Tseitin transformation to handle formulae in conjunctive normal form.
